# Ruby Sass is deprecated and will be unmaintained as of 26 March 2019.

# * If you use Sass as a command-line tool, we recommend using Dart Sass, the new
#   primary implementation: https://sass-lang.com/install

# * If you use Sass as a plug-in for a Ruby web framework, we recommend using the
#   sassc gem: https://github.com/sass/sassc-ruby#readme

# * For more details, please refer to the Sass blog:
